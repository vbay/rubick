     <description>
       Controls whether HBase will check for stream capabilities (hflush/hsync).

       Disable this if you intend to run on LocalFileSystem, denoted by a rootdir
       with the 'file://' scheme, but be mindful of the NOTE below.

       WARNING: Setting this to false blinds you to potential data loss and
       inconsistent system state in the event of process and/or node failures. If
       HBase is complaining of an inability to use hsync or hflush it's most
       likely not a false positive.
